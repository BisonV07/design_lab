This project aims to detect potholes using sensor data from a moving vehicle. 
The system processes accelerometer and gyroscope readings, extracts meaningful statistical and frequency-domain features, 
and classifies road conditions using Machine Learning models.

Key Features:

Real-time Pothole Detection using onboard sensors.
Feature Engineering with Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, Max/Min, and FFT Peaks.
Dimensionality Reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Classification Models:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (RF)
Cross-Validation to ensure model robustness.
